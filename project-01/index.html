        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Michael Buell - I am 31 years old and was born and raised in Nederland, Texas, but my life took 
            an unexpected turn when Hurricane Rita forced my family and I to find dwelling elsewhere in 2006. We 
            ultimately landed in Gladewater, Texas. After graduating high school, I began working as a technician for 
            a security company and as an assistant in the media department at a church while attending Kilgore College. 
            The roles were both exciting and challenging, but I found myself searching for deeper purpose. That search 
            ultimately led me to the Marine Corps recruiting office, where I made the life-changing decision to enlist. 
            I served as an active duty Marine from 2015 to 2019. During this time I was deployed to Iraq and 
            Afghanistan and operated as a Sergeant leading a team of infantry mortarmen. That time was then followed by 
            inactive reserve service until 2022. The experience shaped me in countless ways. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            In early 2020, I met my 
            wife, and together we began building a life in East Texas. Our greatest joy and accomplishment arrived in 
            2023 with the birth of our son, Oliver—though everyone calls him Ollie. Becoming a father has been the most
            rewarding chapter of my life. My goal is to raise Ollie to be a young man of integrity, empathy, and with 
            a sense of humor to carry him through life’s darker moments.
        </p>
        <p>
            As our family grows, so does my desire to grow personally and professionally in support of myself and my 
            family. I’ve returned to academia to finally pursue a degree in a field that has always fascinated me: 
            technology. The ever-evolving nature of technology keeps me curious and engaged, and I’m excited about the 
            opportunities it continues to offer throughout the workforce. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of school and family life, I enjoy spending time with loved ones, attending church, and gaming 
            with some of my buddies. I also have a passion for working on cars and playing instruments like the piano 
            and guitar—creative outlets that keep me grounded through struggles life often presents.
