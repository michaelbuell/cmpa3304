            One of my biggest interests is music and I am interested in lots of different genres. My favorite metal band
            is Metallica. This photo collection showcases a few photos of Metallica Performing live. Metallica is a hugely 
            influential American heavy metal band, often credited as one of the “Big Four” of thrash metal 
            (alongside Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax).

                    Lars Ulrich. Kirk has been the lead guitarist for Metallica since 1983.

                <p class="description">
                    I saw Metallica live at the Rose Bowl Stadium on July 29th, 2017. The show was completely sold out
                    and the stadium was packed. I wasn't sitting close enough to get any good photos, though.

                <p class="description">
                    An interesting fact about Metallica is that they were the <em>first band to play on all seven 
                    continents</em>, including performing a special, quiet, science-friendly show in Antarctica in 
                    2013—earning them a Guinness World Record.

                <p class="description">
                    Here is a shot of James Hetfield performing passionately for the audience. One of my favorite things
                    about Metallica, and something I look for in the bands I listen to, is that they are great performers
                    live. Some might even say they sound better live than their recorded music.
